# [No√© Animal Rescue Organization](https://wfanni.github.io/dog-shelter-landing-page.github.io/)

This 5-day project was our very first group assignment in our frontend journey.
At that time we were only familiar with HTML and CSS and the task was to create a landing page for an NGO. We picked a Hungarian Animal Rescue Organization based in Budapest.
We wanted to make it catchy and show some of the center's residents for the user to feel the urge to adopt one of them.

I personally really liked working on this one, we enjoyed the designing and the coding process and of course, that it could actually help a good cause!

Thanks for reading!
